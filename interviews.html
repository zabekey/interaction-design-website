                    <h4>Overview:</h4>
                    <p> 
                        After chooisng the water dispenser on the fourth floor of the CIT I found it imperative to conduct naturalistc observations
                        in order to understand how users usually interact with the interface. Through this I was able to make objective observations 
                        about thier different experinces with the interfaces including thier stuggles and success with the water dispenser. From this,
                        I was able to craft objective interview questions and conduct interviews in order to learn more about specific users' experinces,
                        expectation, motives, and challanges. I was able to interview three differnt users in which I asked them these questions and 
                        recorded their responses. Below are the questions I asked as well the key points I was able to come across the differnt interviews.

                <div class = "website-content-section">
                    <h4>Interview Questions and Key Obesrvations:</h4>
                    <ol type="1">
                        <li> <u>Briefly describe your experience with the water dispenser.</u></li>
                        <p>
                            Interviewees noted that while having clean and good-tasting water from this dispenser was nice, there were many unspoken 
                            complaints about the interface. A consistent complaint was that having to hover their hands over the sensor was 
                            inconvenient and awkward. Furthermore, the machine dispensed water at a very slow rate making it so that users have to 
                            hover their hands over the sensor for a while resulting in further uncomfortability. It was also often mentioned that 
                            something where the sensor was for the bottle rather than the user's hand would be preferred.
                        </p>
                        <li><u>How easy or hard was it to use the water dispenser?</u></li>
                        <p>
                            Users found that after continued use, the dispenser was fairly easy to use but as first-time users, they faced much more difficulty 
                            and confusion. This is due to the interfaces' unintuitive nature with its excessive signage and misleading indications. 
                        </p>
                        <li><u>What cues helped you understand how to use it?</u></li>
                        <p>
                            Certain cues on the machine pointed users to the correct ways in which to use the dispenser. For instance, there was a white 
                            border around a transparent screen where the user could see the motion sensor camera, bringing the user's attention to that 
                            part of the interface. Furthermore, there is a similar cue yet with a red border around the second motion sensor camera that 
                            controls the temperature of the water dispensed. There are also blocks of text pasted on the dispenser that indicate how to 
                            use the machine itself. This was controversial to users as some found it helpful and took the time to read it whereas others 
                            immediately ignored it assuming that it was unnecessary information. An interviewee stated that “if you design a system such 
                            that you need to explain how to use it, you've already done something wrong”.
                        </p>
                        <li><u>Was the sensor placement comfortable? How did you have to adjust your hand position?</u></li>
                        <p>
                            Users found the position of the sensor overall uncomfortable and placed poorly as it led to awkward hand and arm placements. 
                            One user rested his fingers on top of the dispenser to support his hand hovering over the sensor which they found ironic as 
                            the dispenser was built to be touch-free. The other two users refrained from touching the machines and hovered their hands 
                            but in different ways. One user had their arm straight out to hover thier palm over the sensor while the other rested their 
                            tricep into thier side and used the back of their hand to hover over the sensor. Overall, individuals found the position of 
                            the sensor to be uncomfortable but intuitive it was on the screen facing the user and grouped with the other interactive pieces.
                        </p>
                        <li><u>Can you walk me through your experience of using the dispenser step by step?</u></li>
                        <p>
                            Users approach the machine, unscrew their water bottle, place it under the nozzle, hover their hand over the sensor, get closer 
                            until the perfect distance is reached, allow the bottle to fill up, and then remove the water bottle. Individuals seemed frustrated 
                            over the idea of having to move their hands back and forth incrementally until the sensor noticed a hover as well as the speed at 
                            which water came out.
                        </p>
                        <li><u>Why did you choose to use this dispenser instead of an alternative?</u></li>
                        <p>
                            The most common reason for this was the scarcity of water dispensers and the taste of water from these dispensers. Individuals noted 
                            that this dispenser was the only bottle filler in the CIT compared to the various water fountains which made it hard to fill water bottles. 
                            Furthermore, users trusted the water from this dispenser more than other sources of water due to its taste and perceived cleanliness 
                            through filtering. 
                        </p>
