                    <p> 
                        The public interface I chose to observe was the water dispenser in the kitchen on the 4th floor of the CIT at Brown University. 
                        This dispenser is infamous within the CIT and to those who frequently visit the building as it provides some of the best tasting 
                        water within the building. However, it is known to have many drawbacks such as its location, dispening speed, and most importantly 
                        its confusing user interface. Beacsue of these things, I wanted to observe users' interactions with this interface and conduct interviews
                        to learn more about their eceprinces. From here I then was able to understand these users' needs through creating personas and a stroyboard 
                        around their experiences.

                        The sketch to the right describes the interface and machines as a whole in more detail. Here we can see that the machine has couples differnt 
                        parts being the area where the water gets flle dunder the nozzle, the front frame with the instructions, then the screen with the interface that 
                        the user mainly interacts with. The dispenser is operated by placing the bottle under the nozzle and hovering a hand over the sensor which triggers 
                        the water dispensing mechanism. There are also a variety of lights and buttons on the screen that describe different fucntionalties of the machine.
